===========

This is a Thunderbird extension to draw attention to e-mails that are
simulated phishing attacks.

My employer regularly conducts simulated phishing attempts, and rewards
employees who correctly report such phishing attempts with entry into raffles, despite
[the risks of giving attackers a magic header that can let messages through any other protection](https://twitter.com/_MG_/status/1472043904631394304)
and that [training via simulated phishing exercises has been shown to be ineffective](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2112.07498.pdf).

This extension is intended to indicate such e-mails to me so that
I report them instead of simply just deleting them. My stance here is that
all this extension is doing is either pointing out fake phishing attacks
or that it is pointing out real phishing attacks pretending to be fake
phishing attacks, and in either of those cases deleting or reporting such
messages is the correct action. It does not provide any additional coverage
for real phishing attacks that do not pretend to be fake phishing attacks,
but you were on your own for those anyway.
