===========

This is a Thunderbird extension to draw attention to e-mails that are
simulated phishing attacks.

My employer regularly conducts simulated phishing attempts, and rewards
employees who correctly report such phishing attempts with entry into raffles, despite
[the risks of giving attackers a magic header that can let messages through any other protection](https://twitter.com/_MG_/status/1472043904631394304)
and that [training via simulated phishing exercises has been shown to be ineffective](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2112.07498.pdf).

This extension is intended to indicate such e-mails to me so that
I report them instead of simply just deleting them. It does not provide
any additional coverage for real phishing attacks.
